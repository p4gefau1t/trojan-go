Here is the documentation for Trojan-Go, you can find some tips on how to use it in the left navigation bar, as well as a full description of the configuration file.

Trojan-Go is a complete Trojan proxy implemented in Go, compatible with the Trojan protocol and the original configuration file format. It supports and is compatible with most of the features of the Trojan-GFW version, and extends it with more useful features.

The primary goal of Trojan-Go is to guarantee transmission security and stealth. With this in mind, the performance and ease of use of the transfer is improved as much as possible.
